    <h2>Prof Stephen Hawking has died aged 76. The Cambridge
 theoretical physicist was one of the best-known scientists
 in the world, but what about his discoveries?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>With the Oxford mathematician Roger Penrose,
 he showed that if there was a Big Bang,
 it must have started from an infinitely small point - a singularity.</li>
      <li>Black holes radiate energy known as Hawking radiation, while gradually losing mass.
 This is due to quantum effects near the edge of the black hole, a region called the event horizon.</li>
      <li>He predicted the existence of mini-black holes at the time of the Big Bang. These tiny black holes would have been incredibly hot,
 shedding mass until they vanished - potentially ending their lives in a powerful explosion.</li>
      <li>In the 70s, Hawking considered whether the particles and light entering a black hole were destroyed if the black hole evaporated. Hawking initially thought this "information" was lost from the Universe. But US physicist Leonard Susskind disagreed.
 These ideas became known as the information paradox. In 2004, Hawking conceded that the information must be conserved.</li>
      <li>With the physicist James Hartle, he tried to describe the history of the cosmos in one mathematical expression.
 But quantum theory shows that the distinctions between space and time are unclear.
 As a result, the proposal showed there was little point asking what happened before the Big Bang.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><q>Stephen Hawking was a defining force in the world of science whose loss will be felt in every corner of the globe.
 I was sad that we didnâ€™t agree on everything, but he was still a hero to me as one of our greatest ever thinkers -
 he inspired with his courage as well as his words.</q Jeremy Hunt>
